            >Welcome, <br />
            >Here you will learn Some of the basics of PHP. <br />
            >PHP is a recursive acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is used as an open source general-purpose scripting <br />
            >language. It is very well suited for web developement. It can also be embedded into HTML. <br />
            > <br />
            >To use PHP on a page you must use start and end brackets, like a normal Div in HTML. Here is an example. <br />
            >&emsp;&lt;?php<br />
            >&emsp;&emsp;echo "Hi, I'm a PHP script!";<br />
            >&emsp;?&gt; <br />
            >The code above will display "Hi, I'm a PHP script!" on the page.<br />
            > <br />
            >As opposed to other programming languages such as HTML, which is client side, PHP is server side. This means that <br/>
            >your browser is not interpreting it, rather the code is being run on a server and relayed <br />
            >back to your browser for you to view. <br />
            >Isn't that cool! <br />
            > <br />
            >One of the best reasons to use PHP is that the coding is made simple for those new to programming, but also has a <br />
            >plethora of features for professionals. <br />
            > <br />
            >One of the strongest and most useful features that PHP has is support for many types of databases. One of the more <br />
            >popular database extensions is mysql. <br />
            > <br />
            >That's all I have for you today! But to find out more please click <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php">here.</a>
