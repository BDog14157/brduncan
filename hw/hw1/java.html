            >Welcome, <br />
            >Here you will learn Some of the basics of JavaScript. <br />
            >JavaScript is often abbreviated as "JS". JS is one of the three core technologies for Web production, alongside HTML <br />
            >and CSS. <br />
            > <br />
            >While JavaScript used to be only client-side, it is now being implemented server-side as well. While Java and JavaScript <br />
            >are very similar in terms of language name, syntax, and standard libraries, the two differ largely in design. Javascript <br />
            >was influenced by other languages such as <strong>Self</strong> and <strong>Scheme</strong>.
            ><br />
            >Here is a quick example of something you can do in JS. <br />
            <button type="button"
            onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">
            Click me to display Date and Time.</button>

            <p id="demo"></p>
            <br />
            >Isn't that cool! Click <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/">here</a> to see how we did it! <br />
            >And also click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">here</a> for more information about JavaScript!
